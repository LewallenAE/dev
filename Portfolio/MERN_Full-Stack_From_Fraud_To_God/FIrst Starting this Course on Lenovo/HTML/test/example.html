    <!--This is an example of the incorrect way to make a comment. So listen up
    and be mindful. Because the two comments below are the correct
    way to make comments on a website. But if we put an angular bracket, a exclamation
    point and then place a double hyphen or dash. This will then
    make it the correct way to make a comment.-->
    <h1>This is my first website</h1>
    <p>I am super excited to start designing my own websites.</p>
    <!-- A comment allows us to place things in our code as a reminder, attention grabber, or example. -->
    <!-- What makes it even better, is it won't show up on the website. It will only show up in the code.  -->
    <!-- You can also short cut by holding the ctrl key and then typing a /. However this shortcut will only work per line
    <!-- Or if you select the whole comment on multiple lines you will be able to use it that way as well to make everything you select a comment. --> 
    <!-- You can also select a new line, hold ctrl key and click / and it will create a comment. You can then type as much as you want to make a comment. 
    Try this yourself. Now that the comments are made go ahead and right click and then select "Open with live server". Let's see if all of this text shows up.
    Create a new HTML file for the next sections which is All Basic HTML tags.-->
